## Backup of the MECM Site:  

- Access to https://reportingdollaru.bcc.com/rapportchaine.php?chaine=SCCJSVAPNA&noeud=BYCNP06 to check all the status are ok

- On ProxyAdmin, connect to xxxSSRV148 with S1 
- In the file explorer, go to **\\BYDATA02\SCCM_sauvegarde** and verify inside the folders Â«â€¯xxxSSRV148 Â», Â«â€¯xxxSDBA110 Â» and Â«â€¯xxxSDBA111 Â» that a current or previous dayâ€™s date folder has been created and that it contains data.  

  ![alt text](</assets/2024/02/Screenshot_2024-02-07_142744.png>)

- If there is any problem, open an Oasis ticket with the category **Incidents/infrastructure/MECM**  
- Stay connected to xxxSSRV148 

## Inbox folders of MECM Site servers 

- In the file explorer, go to 
  ```
  \\xxxSSRV148\e$\Microsoft Configuration Manager\Inboxes
  ```
  If this is your first connection, you may have to access this folder manually and to create a folder Â«â€¯Temp Â» 

- There are 10 folders to check. It is recommended to pin them for quick access. 

  - **compsumm**.box: Move the files older than 7 days to Â«â€¯Temp Â» 
  - **ddm**.box: Move the files older than 7 days to Â«â€¯Temp Â» 
  - **auth\dataldr.box\badmifs**: count the number of .MIF files with this PowerShell command. If the numbers exceed about 300, open an incident.  
    ```powershell
    Get-ChildItem -Path "E:\Microsoft Configuration Manager\inboxes\auth\dataldr.box\BADMIFS" -Include *.MIF -Recurse | ?{$_.LastWriteTime -ge (Get-date).AddDays(-2)} | Measure-object 
    ```
  - **hman**.box: Move the files older than 7 days to Â«â€¯Temp Â». The parent folder must not contain more than 5 files. Do NOT touch the subdirectories. 
  - **sinv.box\badsinv**: count the number of .SID files with this PowerShell command. If the numbers exceed about 300, open an incident. 
    ```powershell
    Get-ChildItem -Path "E:\Microsoft Configuration Manager\inboxes\sinv.box\BADSINV" -Include *.SID -Recurse | ?{$_.LastWriteTime -ge (Get-date).AddDays(-2)} | Measure-object 
    ```
  - **statmgr.box**: Move the files older than 7 days to Â«â€¯Temp Â» 
  - **auth\statesys.box\corrupt**: Move the files older than 7 days to Â«â€¯Temp Â» 
  - **auth\ddm.box\regreq\bad_ddrs**: Move the files older than 7 days to Â«â€¯Temp Â» 
  - **COLLEVAL.box**: Move the files older than 7 days to Â«â€¯Temp Â» 
  - **ccrretry.box**: Move the files older than 7 days to Â«â€¯Temp Â» 

- In case of problems, open an Oasis ticket with the category Â«â€¯**Incidents/infrastructure/MECM** Â»  
- Stay connected to xxxSSRV148 

## Primary site performances 

- Open Â«â€¯**Task Manager** Â» column and check if both CPU and Memory are below 40% 
- If there is any problem, create an Oasis ticket with the category Â«â€¯**Incidents/infrastructure/MECM** Â»  
- Stay connected to xxxSSRV148 

## Distribution of failed packages 

- Open with Run as administrator Â«â€¯Windows Powershell Â»  
- To list the failed package distributions, execute the command 
  ```powershell
  E:\scripts\packages_error.ps1 -GridView
  ```
- Copy the results of the command and paste them in an Excel File. Use the formula Â«â€¯CONCAT Â» to assemble PAP**** and ****.***.bcc.COM 

  ![alt text](</assets/2024/02/Screenshot_2024-02-07_143252.png>)

- Copy the results and paste them in the file
  ```
  E:\scripts\Packages_a_redistribuer
  ```
  on xxxSSRV148 (delete the content before paste) 
- Execute the command 
  ```
  & 'E:\scripts\redistribute_packages on DPs.ps1' 
  ```
- For each package, you must get the value Â«â€¯True Â» as result of the redistribution   
  If you do not, report it and open an Oasis incident with the category Â«â€¯**Incidents/infrastructure/MECM** Â»   
- Log out from xxxSSRV148

- Expand Databases and right-click on CM-PAP to select Â«â€¯New query Â» (You need to open two new queries) 
  - Query 1. Copy the text below and do Execute 
  ```sql
  SELECT  
     USS.LastScanPackageLocation as WUserver 
     ,count(distinct(S.Netbios_Name0)) as NbMachine 
     ,SN.StateName AS [LastScanState] 
     ,MAX(ScanTime) as MinScanTime 
     ,MAX(ScanTime) as MaxScanTime 
  FROM v_UpdateScanStatus as USS 
  INNER JOIN v_R_System S ON USS.ResourceID = S.ResourceID  
  INNER JOIN v_StateNames  as SN ON USS.LastScanState = SN.StateID and TopicType in (501) 
  INNER JOIN [dbo].[v_FullCollectionMembership] FC on FC.ResourceID=USS.ResourceID 
  where uss.LastScanPackageLocation <> 'https://xxxVSRV511.bcc.com:8531' 
  group by USS.LastScanPackageLocation,SN.StateName 
  having count(distinct(S.Netbios_Name0)) > 10 
  union 
  SELECT  
     USS.LastScanPackageLocation as WUserver 
     ,count(distinct(S.Netbios_Name0)) as NbMachine 
     ,SN.StateName AS [LastScanState] 
     ,MAX(ScanTime) as MinScanTime 
     ,MAX(ScanTime) as MaxScanTime 
  FROM v_UpdateScanStatus as USS 
  INNER JOIN v_R_System S ON USS.ResourceID = S.ResourceID  
  INNER JOIN v_StateNames  as SN ON USS.LastScanState = SN.StateID and TopicType in (501) 
  INNER JOIN [dbo].[v_FullCollectionMembership] FC on FC.ResourceID=USS.ResourceID 
  where uss.LastScanPackageLocation = 'https://xxxVSRV511.bcc.com:8531' 
  and s.Operating_System_Name_and0 like '%server%' 
  group by USS.LastScanPackageLocation,SN.StateName 
  --having count(distinct(S.Netbios_Name0)) > 4 
  order by 1 
  ```
  - Query 2. Copy the text below and do Execute 
  ```sql
  SELECT  
  SN.StateName AS [LastScanState] 
     ,count(distinct(S.Netbios_Name0)) as NbMachine 
     ,MAX(ScanTime) as MinScanTime 
     ,MAX(ScanTime) as MaxScanTime 
  FROM v_UpdateScanStatus as USS 
  INNER JOIN v_R_System S ON USS.ResourceID = S.ResourceID  
  INNER JOIN v_StateNames  as SN ON USS.LastScanState = SN.StateID and TopicType in (501) 
  INNER JOIN [dbo].[v_FullCollectionMembership] FC on FC.ResourceID=USS.ResourceID

  having count(distinct(S.Netbios_Name0)) > 10 
  order by 2 desc

- If there are more than 30% failed for xxxVSRV511 or more than 10% on another server, create an Oasis ticket with the category Â«â€¯**Incidents/infrastructure/MECM** Â»
